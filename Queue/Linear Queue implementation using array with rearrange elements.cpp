     * After dequeuing an element we can't access that position by enqueuing process until the queue is completely empty.
     * From the above example (or previous program) our queue size is 5,
     * we enqueued 5 elements and dequeued 2 element then we should have 2 free spaces to add element.
     * Like if we add an element below after deque an element in the previous program
     * enqueue(30);
     * â†³ It will say [QUEUE IS FULL]! ... ...
     * Because after dequeuing element(s), the existing elements position weren't rearranged,
     * and the last element staying at last index so it says queue is full.
     * To avoid this problem we called rearrange method after every dequeuing an element at the line #43,
     * so existing element will be shifted to the front (or lower index).
     *
     * Now we can enqueue as many elements as have been dequeued.
